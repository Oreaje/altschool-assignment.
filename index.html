        <p>I joined AltSchool to gain hands-on experience with real-world projects, enabling me to build a strong foundation for my career. I also wanted to connect with a community of like-minded learners, fostering collaboration and teamwork. Through this program, I aim to develop essential skills, gain exposure to practical challenges, and position myself for success in the ever-evolving tech industry</p>
        <h2 id="goals">My Goals</h2>
        <p>My ambition extends beyond mastering frontend technologies. I aspire to use the skills I acquire to develop an innovative digital platform that contributes to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), driving technological progress and economic empowerment. Through this platform, I envision fostering entrepreneurship, creating opportunities for aspiring developers, and shaping a thriving digital economy.

            Beyond technology, I see this journey as a launchpad into leadership and policy-making, where I can advocate for forward-thinking policies that promote technological advancement and sustainable economic growth. Inspired by visionaries like Elon Musk, I am committed to building a future defined by innovation, collaboration, and transformative ideas—one that not only impacts Nigeria but extends its influence globally.</p>
